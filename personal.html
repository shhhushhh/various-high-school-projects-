<h1> Shirley Li </h1>

<p> <img src="/users/shirl/downloads/shirley.jpg" alt="me"> I'm a rising senior attending Lynbrook High School. Due to the 
    quarantine, I didn't really know what to do in regards to 
    summer. As such, I applied for <span class="Stanford">Stanford</span> Summer Session so 
    I could get a headstart on obtaining college credit. 
</p>
<p>In school,
    I am a field hockey player, Zentangle club officer, and DECA member.
    Outside of school, I am a chorister. I also enjoy eating food and 
    watching <span class="Stanford">Stanford</span> women's field hockey matches. Something
    that I really crave for right now is the Passion Fruit Green Tea Combo
    from TeaTop. I also want to go out and get dim sum. But alas, the 
    quarantine is still kind of in place and I'm too scared to
    go outside anyways lol. 
</p>
<p>Here's a list of my main hobbies:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Reading web novels, <a href="http://archiveofourown.org">fanfiction</a>, and literature 
        (my favorite play is <span class="wfg">Waiting for Godot</span> and
        my favorite novel is <span class="cr">Cannery Row</span>)
    </li>
    <li> Playing <a href="http://reddit.com/r/magiarecord/">gacha games</a> 
    </li>
    <li> Exercising/Playing field hockey</li>
    <li> Singing and listening to contemporary orchestra 
        music
    </li>
</ul>
